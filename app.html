		HTML is the language for building websites. It is in charge of Text content, Mark up, References to images and videos, and links to other pages.

	HTML uses elements (tags) to instruct the computer on what and how to display a web page. There are various types of tags, some that are what is know as in line and some that are known as Block. There are also certain tags know as void tags, unlike all other tags, these tags do not require a closing tag, 

	CSS is the language for styling various things. It is in Charge of Text and or Image Color, Size, Shape, and Website Styles.

			In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the most important thing of all is to avoid repetition as much as HUMANLY possible! It takes up extra space, time, and creates more complications further along. The most specific rules in CSS apply to every element (no very specific). The language itself relies on inheritance, which is a big idea that requires lots of abstract thinking. A selector defines what elements of the page a rule applies to. Although DIVs are <b>block</b> elements, they can be changed to <b>in line</b> by being overridden by the CSS command, (display: flex;) To ensure your code is correct and working, you should go through a series or checks (inspections). These checks involve you first looking for natural boxes. Then looking for repeated styles and semantic elements. Once you have looked and made sure neither of these exist in your code it is time to start writing your HTML. After this, you should apply your CSS styles, (BIGGEST to smallest). Now you should be testing your code and fixing anything that is hindering its ability to work properly. Once you have done all these, you can continue to write your code, but make sure you stop every once in a while and repeat this checking process. </div>

					 The Internet is a huge place that is a great resource for learning new things. WWW stands for World Wide Web. The web works by the computers communicating each other. For example if somebody goes to www.apple.com, your computer sends that to the server. Then the server finds the appropriate HTML file and sends it back for the computer to display to the user.

					 	HTML is the universal language for programing websites. It stands for <em> HyperText Mark Up Language.</em> HTML is based of of elements (tags).These tags can either be in line or block. In line obviously meaning the text is in line and the formating doesn't change, while block, means that the text gets its own line and has an "invisible box" around it.
